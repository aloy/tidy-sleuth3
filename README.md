# tidy-sleuth3

These materials were originally developed for @aloy's Math 245: Applied Regression Analysis course at Carleton College. This work [adapts work done by Linda Loi, Ruobing Zhang, Kate Aloisio, and Nicholas J. Horton](http://www.math.smith.edu/~nhorton/sleuth3/). Their work leveraged initiatives undertaken by Project MOSAIC (http://www.mosaic-web.org), an NSF-funded effort to improve the teaching of statistics, calculus, science and computing in the undergraduate curriculum. Key adaptations include using `ggformula` for visualization and other tidyverse tools (such as `dplyr`) for data manipulation. Further, `broom` is used to help extract key model components.

The course at Carleton covers chapters 7-12 and 20-22 in *The Statistical Sleuth* by Fred Ramsey and Dan Schafer, and shapters 1 and 2 were reviewed during the first week.

While the above chapters were the initial focus of the project, the goal is to provide provide materials for every chapter in *The Statistical Sleuth*. Contributions are welcome!
